This year one of my resolutions is to take up more outdoor activities.So this is an app to record and track that.The app will take many diffrent features that the end user may be able to first add activities,track them and be able to set remiders if the user has surpassed the set deadline having not completed the activity.

The first stage was creating the authentication Feature.This would ensure that the user is logged-in inorder to access his dashboard.
This Stage was made possible by using proctected Routes that rely on the global context user which is stored in the Local storage.
In short i created an authentification mechanism that checks the availability of the user state that is accessible globaly by the user context
